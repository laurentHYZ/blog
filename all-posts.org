You are an emacs magit expert.
I want to use magit to push changes to origin, and I want to force that push. What is the keybinding for that?

The keybinding to push changes to origin and force push is =P -f=. This will invoke the "Push popup" of Magit, where you can select the branch you want to push and add the force option.
